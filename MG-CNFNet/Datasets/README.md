> The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.Loni.usc.edu) are shared through the secure research data repository LONI Image and Data Archive (IDA), which includes four sub-datasets, namely ANDI 1, ADNI 2, ADNI 3 and ADNI GO. In this paper, experiments were conducted from For the three different pathological states of ADNI, MCI, and CN, 130 images in ADNI1, 40 images in ADNI2, and 30 images in ADNI3 were selected as the training set; the test and validation sets were divided consistently, with 40 images in ADNI1, 40 images in ADNI2, and 40 images in ADNI3. In the test and validation sets, 40 images were selected from ADNI1, 30 images from ADNI2, and 30 images from ADNI3, for a total of 300 images. 1200 images were selected for the experiments. The investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.
